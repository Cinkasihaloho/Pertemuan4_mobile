As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social, and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.", "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.CJUcKd5aVQzC1HkGsiyZ7QHaKU?pid=Api&rs=1"},

However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends.", "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.awU161NIfyvEEn96gII_YQHaJ4?pid=Api&rs=1"},

Following Voldemort's sudden return and the start of the Second Wizarding War after the resignation of Cornelius Fudge, Dumbledore swiftly formed and lead the second Order of the Phoenix. He would also support Jacob's sibling in the latter's quest for the Cursed Vaults, and consistently aid the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione during their first six years at Hogwarts, thus leading them to name Dumbledore's Army after him", "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.EkLf9RM1kz17sl06pHCyYgHaFj?pid=Api&rs=1"},

This put him in the same year as Lily but unfortunately for him in rival houses. Severus became the immediate enemy of James Potter and Sirius Black and was a frequent victim of their bullying. This led him to be irritable towards James's son Harry when he was a professor. Snape, when young, developed a passion for the Dark Arts, which increased as his desire for revenge grew stronger. Snape became involved with the bullies in Slytherin House, many of whom were pure-blood supremacists. This put his friendship with Lily, a Muggle-born, under great strain until it was eventually broken in their fifth year.[6][7] In an attempt to win back Lily's affections,[17] Snape joined the Death Eaters along with a group of his fellow Slytherins.", "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.jLVubi2HxH68UQnZI-JSfQHaD8?pid=Api&rs=1"},

Throughout his school years, he was mostly a shy, clumsy, introverted boy who was constantly being told by his grandmother that he was not good enough or living up to his parents' accomplishments. However, in his later years, he showed that he possessed great courage and perseverance: he became an important member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter with the goal of helping other students learn spells to attack and defend themselves. Neville would later fight in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996), the Battle of the Astronomy Tower (1997), and the Battle of Hogwarts (1998).

Her mother was Merope Gaunt, a pure-blooded witch from gaunt's family,the last descendant of Hogwarts co-founder Salazar Slytherin. Merope uses the Love Potion to lure tom riddle senior. Eventually Tom Riddle Sr. became infatuated with Merope and they eloped to London. After 3 months of marriage, Merope conceived Tom Riddle Junior (Voldemort), then she decided to stop using the Love Potion on Tom Riddle Sr. because she thought Tom Riddle Sr. had reciprocated in love with her. Maybe he thought Tom Sr. was going to stay for his son. However, the allegations are both false. Tom Sr. left him, never visited him again, and never bothered to find out what happened to his son. So by the time she neared the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of money, desperately needing it to the point of being forced to sell her only invaluable possession, the Slytherin pendant, to Caractus Burke which sold for only 10 Galleons. In fact, the necklace is priceless. When Voldemort was born, he was left in an orphanage. Merope chose to die instead of using magic power to survive.", "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.zR7OlcLiEBr9CR5dBz7zNAHaHa?pid=Api&rs=1"},
            {"Draco Malfoy", "Draco serves as a foil to the hero, Harry Potter and is loosely based on bullies Rowling encountered during her school days.[1] Harry first encounters Draco's snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin's. Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments. Draco, adhering to his family's beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet Mudbloods, should be denied a magical education. Harry's first impression that the Wizarding community is a \"magical wonderland\" is instantly shattered. Says Rowling, \"[Harry] found out that many people in power in the wizarding world are just as corrupt and nasty as they are in our world.\"[2]", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Draco_Mal.JPG"},
